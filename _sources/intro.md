# Machine Learning Handbook

This book contains theorical explanations and Python-based demonstrations for various Machine Learning concepts, techniques and tools.

It was created for the Machine Learning course taught at French engineering schools [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr). [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr) and [IOGS](https://www.institutoptique.fr).

Because this book is built with [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), you can launch live Jupyter sessions in the cloud directly from any chapter. To do so, open a chapter, press the rocket button in the toolbar above and select an online notebook service. You will be able to interact with the code and regenerate the chapter output.

This book is always evolving, with new content added regularly.
