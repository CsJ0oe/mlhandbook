# Machine Learning Handbook

This book provides theorical explanations, Python-based demonstrations and practical challenges for various Machine Learning concepts, techniques and tools.

It is the main textbook for courses I teach at French engineering schools [ENSC](https://ensc.bordeaux-inp.fr). [ENSEIRB-MATMECA](https://enseirb-matmeca.bordeaux-inp.fr) and [IOGS](https://www.institutoptique.fr). Its content is inspired by a large number of sources, from which many ideas and some illustrations were borrowed ([more details](./appendix/acknowledgments.md)).

Demonstrations and challenges leverage the essential tools of the Python ecosystem for Machine Learning: [NumPy](tools/numpy), [pandas](tools/pandas), [scikit-learn](tools/scikit-learn), [Keras](tools/keras) and [PyTorch](tools/pytorch).

The book content is designed to be browsed thematically rather than sequentially.
