# Machine Learning Handbook

This repository contains the source files of the [Machine Learning Handbook](https://bpesquet.github.io/mlhandbook), an interactive book containing explanations and Python-based demonstrations for various Machine Learning concepts, techniques and tools.

The book content is written as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

HTML output is generated by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org).

## Development notes

### Generating HTML output

Execute the following command in the root folder of the book.

```bash
jupyter-book build .
```

### Exporting a notebook to a PDF file

Use [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io) in the same directory as the source file:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to PDF <chapter_file_name>.ipynb
```

> For now, GIF files must be replaced by their PNG counterparts before launching the conversion process.
